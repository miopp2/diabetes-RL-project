# diabetes-RL-project

This project aims to compare different controllers for (autonomous) insulin infusion. For this purpose the basic implementations of the [T1D simulator](https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose) and [Reinforcement learning algorithms](https://github.com/MHamza-Y/Autonomous-Insulin-Infusion-Controller) were used and adapted. 

## Installation

To install the repository and all required packages (using pip): 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose.git
cd simglucose
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Comments
- if running the code on windows change ''start_method': 'fork'' to ''start_method': 'spawn''
